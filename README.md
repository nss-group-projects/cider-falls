# Cider Falls

This project has your team building an application for the Cider Falls National Park that will track park area, park activities, and park guests.

## Professional Collaboration

In this project, you are expected to start building your professional collaboration skills by writing issue tickets and having professional pull requests. During your wireframing and algorithmic thinking design process, you are going to be creating tickets for your efforts.

### Tickets

As a team, review the [Writing a proper GitHub issue](https://medium.com/nyc-planning-digital/writing-a-proper-github-issue-97427d62a20f) article so learn the basics of how you should approach creating a ticket to describe work that must be done on the project.

All tickets will be added to a project board. Here's how you set that up.

1. Go to the team's Github repository page.
2. Click on the **Projects** tab at the top.
3. At the top of this view, you will see a green **Link a project** button, click on the down arrow on the right of it.
4. Choose **New project** then click on the green button.
5. Choose **Board** from the types on the window that appears.
6. Enter in **Exomine** in the _Project name_ input field at the top.
7. Click green **Create project** at the bottom.

To create a issue ticket for your project, follow these steps.

1. Go to the team's Github repository page.
2. Click on the **Issues** tab at the top.
3. Click the **New Issue** button.

Finally, once a ticket is created...

1. Go to your project board.
2. At the bottom of the _To do_ column, click on the plus sign.
3. Click on the plus sign again.
4. Choose **Add item from repository**
5. In the window that appears, make sure your team repository is chosen in the dropdown.
6. All tickets that you have created will appear in a list.
7. Choose them all
8. Click the green **Add selected items** button at the bottom.


### Pull Requests

As a team, review the [Writing A Great Pull Request Description](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/writing-a-great-pull-request-description/) article. When each teammate pushes a branch to be reviewed and/or approved by a peer, it is expected that a comprehensive, detailed description has been added to the pull request.
