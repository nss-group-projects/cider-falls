## Professional Collaboration

In this project, you are expected to start building your professional collaboration skills by writing issue tickets and having professional pull requests. During your wireframing and algorithmic thinking design process, you are going to be creating tickets for your efforts.

Here's the link to the [Github Workflow Guides](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/github-workflow/) that everyone must use during this project.

You will need to clone this repository, create a project board, and create issue tickets once you have used your analytical and algorithmic thinking to define tasks. Make sure you review all articles and videos that we provide for you in the guides. You are expected to produce high quality documentation.
